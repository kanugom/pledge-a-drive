          You understand that all information entered by the user is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not the Developer, are entirely responsible for all Content that you submit or otherwise make available via PTD.

You understand that by using PTD, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Under no circumstances will the City be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content submitted or otherwise made available via PTD.
        %p
          We are under no obligation to enforce this Agreement on your behalf against another user. While we encourage you to let us know if you believe another user violated this Agreement, we reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action at the City's sole discretion.
